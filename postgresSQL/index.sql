-- ### Explanation of the Solution:

-- The task is to find the **big countries** based on two criteria:
-- - The country has an area of at least **3,000,000 km²**, or
-- - The country has a population of at least **25,000,000** people.

--  **SQL Query:**
--    The SQL query to fetch the required data looks like this:
   ```postgresql []
   SELECT name, population, area
   FROM World
   WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
   ```

-- ### Breakdown of the Query:

-- - **`SELECT name, population, area`**: This selects the columns we want to include in the result, namely `name`, `population`, and `area` of the country.

-- - **`FROM World`**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.

-- - **`WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000`**: This is the condition that filters the rows. It checks:
--   - If the country's area is at least 3,000,000 km² (`area >= 3000000`), or
--   - If the country's population is at least 25,000,000 people (`population >= 25000000`).
  
--   The **OR** ensures that any country meeting either one of these criteria will be included in the result.

-- ### Example Walkthrough:

-- Given the `World` table:

-- | name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
-- |-------------|-----------|---------|------------|--------------|
-- | Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
-- | Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
-- | Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
-- | Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
-- | Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |

-- - **Afghanistan**: Has a population of 25,500,100, which is greater than 25,000,000, so it's included.
-- - **Albania**: Does not meet either condition (its area and population are too small), so it's excluded.
-- - **Algeria**: Has a population of 37,100,000 and an area of 2,381,741 km². Even though the area is less than 3,000,000 km², the population exceeds the threshold, so it's included.
-- - **Andorra**: Both area and population are below the thresholds, so it's excluded.
-- - **Angola**: Does not meet either condition, so it's excluded.

-- ### Final Output:

-- | name        | population | area    |
-- |-------------|------------|---------|
-- | Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
-- | Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
